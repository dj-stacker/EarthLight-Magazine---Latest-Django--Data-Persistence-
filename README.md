About This Site
This website was created instantly by a single bash file.
If you have never run this file before, you must replace YOURUSERNAME in all of the paths
with your actual username.
Also, create the folder "~/betterLive' and run this file from inside that folder in your Terminal window.
log on to Terminal and enter
cd ~
at the prompt.
You should be in your username root folder, the one which you must replace YOURUSERNAME with this folder's name.
do
mkdir betterLive
in terminal, do
cd betterLive
do
chmod +x filename.sh
do
./filename.sh
use the filename you named this file when you copied it or downloaded it.

Django powers this site, it has data persistance from external backups.

It allows the logged in member to post Articles, Videos and Images!

If the website becomes corrupted or broken, running external_media_article.sh over again will fix it.

# EarthLight Magazine — Build Script Overview (Final Version)

This document describes how the current Django build script for EarthLight Magazine works, including:
• What the script generates
• How backups are handled
• Where external folders live
• How recursion/disk growth is prevented
• What the finished site contains

This is a complete description of the new system.

# 1. High-Level Operation of the Script

Each time the script is run, it performs a full rebuild of the Django project:

/Users/YOURUSERNAME/better_Live/LiveShowSite

The script does the following:

1. Creates stable external directories for media and static files:
   /Users/YOURUSERNAME/better_Live/media
   /Users/YOURUSERNAME/better_Live/static

2. Creates and activates a virtual environment inside:
   LiveShowSite/venv

3. Installs required Python packages:
   Django, Django-Allauth, Django-CKEditor, MoviePy, Pillow

4. Generates the Django project and the entertainment app.
5. Creates all required Django files:
   - settings.py (with correct media/static paths)
   - models.py for Articles, Photos, Videos
   - forms.py, views.py, urls.py
   - CKEditor upload permission view
   - All templates (base, home, article detail, lists, upload forms, etc.)

6. Applies migrations.
7. Restores previous DB/media/static from backup if present.
8. Copies static files into the project’s internal static folder for convenience.
9. Runs collectstatic.
The result is a fully working, authenticated, media-enabled Django site.

# 2. Website Features Generated by the Script

## Articles
- Rich-text editing with CKEditor
- Optional image
- Pagination
- Full-page detail view
- Snippet preview system (iframe)
- Edit/delete support

## Photos
- Upload and display
- Stored in external media directory
- Delete with permission checks

## Videos
- Upload MP4 files
- Auto-generate thumbnail via ffmpeg/moviepy
- Optional custom thumbnail
- Displays with correct poster attribute

## Authentication (Allauth)
- Login, logout, registration
- Password reset
- Email verification
- Integrated Bootstrap templates

## Static Assets
- Logo, favicon, other images
- Served from external static directory
- Referenced via {% static %}

## CKEditor Integration
- Authenticated uploads only
- Uploads stored in external media directory
- Permission view enforces user.is_authenticated

# 3. Backup System (Safe, Non-Recursive)

The script uses a single stable location for backups:

/Users/YOURUSERNAME/better_Live/backups

It creates the following backups:

## Database:
backups/db_backup.sqlite3

## Media:
backups/media_backup/            (internal media from old project)
backups/media_backup_external/   (external user media)

## Static:
backups/static_backup_external/

## Safety
- Backups are NOT stored inside the project folder.
- The project folder is deleted before regeneration.
- No copy command ever targets a subfolder of its own destination.
- Therefore no recursive folder growth or disk explosion can occur.

# 4. External Folder Layout

All persistent data lives outside the project:

/Users/blocky_mcblockface/better_Live/
    media/
        video_thumbnails/
        videos/
        photos/
        uploads/ckeditor/
    static/
        images/
            favicon.ico
            favicon.png
            logo.png
    backups/

These folders survive every rebuild and remain untouched except for restoration.

# 5. External Paths Used by the Script

The only paths outside the project the script interacts with:

/Users/YOURUSERNAME/better_Live/media
/Users/YOURUSERNAME/better_Live/static
/Users/YOURUSERNAME/better_Live/backups

No other external locations are modified.

# 6. Summary

The build script provides a stable, safe, repeatable Django deployment:
- No recursion
- No runaway disk usage
- All backups safely located outside the project
- All media/static paths aligned
- Full site regeneration each run
- All user data preserved
